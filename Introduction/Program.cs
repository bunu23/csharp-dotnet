Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");

// This is a simple C# console application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// It serves as a basic introduction to C# programming and the .NET environment.
// It compiles your code into an executable format that a computer can understand.
// It runs your compiled application and, when written correctly, will output "Hello World!"
// To run this code, you can use the .NET CLI or an IDE like Visual Studio.

Console.Write("Congratulations!");
Console.Write(" ");
Console.Write("Your wrote your first line of C# code.");

// Difference between Console.Write and Console.WriteLine:
// Console.Write does not add a new line after the output, while Console.WriteLine does.
// Console.WriteLine automatically appends a new line after the output, moving the cursor to the next line.
