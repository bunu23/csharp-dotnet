### Guided Project- Calculate and Print Student Grades

You are developing a Student Grading application that automates the calculation of current grades for each student in a class. The parameters for your application are:

- You're given a short list of four students and their five assignment grades.
- Each assignment grade is expressed as an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
- Final scores are calculated as an average of the five assignment scores.
- Your application needs to perform basic math operations to calculate the final grades for each student.
- Your application needs to output/display each student’s name and final score.

Currently, the teachers grade book shows the graded assignments for each student as follows:

Sample Example:

```
Sophia: 93, 87, 98, 95, 100

Nicolas: 80, 83, 82, 88, 85

Zahirah:   84, 96, 73, 85, 79

Jeong:  90, 92, 98, 100, 97
```

The teacher requires that the calculated grades for each student are displayed as follows:

```
Student     Grade
Sophia      94.6  A
Nicolas     83.6  B
Zahirah     83.4  B
Jeong       95.4  A
```

### Guided Project - Calculate Final GPA

You're developing a Student GPA Calculator that will help calculate students' overall Grade Point Average. The parameters for your application are:

- You're given the student's name and class information.
- Each class has a name, the student's grade, and the number of credit hours for that class.
- Your application needs to perform basic math operations to calculate the GPA for the given student.
- Your application needs to output/display the student’s name, class information, and GPA.

  To calculate the GPA:

- Multiply the grade value for a course by the number of credit hours for that course.
- Do this for each course, then add these results together.
- Divide the resulting sum by the total number of credit hours.

You're provided with the following sample of a student's course information and GPA:

```

Sample Example:

Student: Sophia Johnson

Course Grade Credit Hours
English 101 4 3
Algebra 101 3 3
Biology 101 3 4
Computer Science I 3 4
Psychology 101 4 3

Final GPA: 3.35
```
